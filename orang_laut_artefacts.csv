The computer-controlled fountain was able to display 16 different water formations in time to familiar local, classical and Broadway tunes such as Singapura, Little White Boat and My Fair Lady.

In 1970, the island was renamed Sentosa following a naming contest organised by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB). The development of the island into a tourist and recreation resort came under the management of the Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC), which was formed in 1972.In 1980, the STPB announced plans for a second round of development to attract more visitors to Sentosa. The plans included the construction of a musical fountain on a reclaimed area of Imbiah Bay. A contract was subsequently awarded to Venus Enterprises to construct the fountain, which was officially opened in June 1982. Two months prior to its launch, SDC organised a contest to find a new name for the attraction. However, none of the entries were found to be suitable and the original name, Musical Fountain, was retained.Built at a cost of $3.2 million, the fountain initially comprised of a swan-shaped main pool, two terrace pools, and a viewing gallery that could accommodate up to 1,000 people. The computer-controlled fountain was able to display 16 different water formations in time to familiar local, classical and Broadway tunes such as Singapura, Little White Boat and My Fair Lady. To mark its official opening, the Pains Fireworks company was invited over from London to set up a spectacular silvery fireworks display. A fibreglass ‘rock’ wall was added to the popular attraction in 1985.",Object size: 10.4 x 14.8 cm,,National Museum of Singapore,1149937,https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1149937

The development of the island into a tourist and recreation resort came under the management of the Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC), which was formed in 1972.One of the projects under the development plan for Sentosa was an aquarium and marine park. The government established a holding company, Singapore Aquarama, to manage the project, which was meant to draw tourists and increase the country’s standing in the ornamental fish industry. However, the company was wound up in 1973 and the project put on hold. Talk of restarting the project surfaced in the early 1980s and included a suggestion for the Van Kleef Aquarium on the mainland to be relocated on Sentosa.The project was eventually revived in 1987 when a contract was awarded to New Zealand’s Marinescape Corporation to develop the Sentosa Underwater World oceanarium. Opened in 1991, the highlight of the attraction was a 100-metre transparent underwater tunnel that allowed visitors to view the marine life in two large aquariums without getting wet.",Object size: 8.9 x 14.9 cm,,National Museum of Singapore,1159425,https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1159425

While the ‘Orang Laut’ (indigenes) traditionally lived in small boats, by the end of the 17th century, a few had moved into houses.

According to one legend, the island was named after a pirate queen named Keng from the Johore-Riau Archipelago, who had settled on the island with her followers sometime in the 18th century. The island’s inhabitants referred to themselves as Orang Selat (People of the Straits) or Orang Laut (People of the Sea), with some claiming to be the original inhabitants of Singapore island, while others were believed to be the descendants of pirates. The islanders lived in ‘attap’ houses built on stilts along the coastline and earned a living mostly as fishermen or workers in the Shell Eastern Petroleum oil refinery on neighbouring Pulau Bukom. The island’s inhabitants were shifted into new public flats on the mainland in 1994 to enable the conversion of the island into a landfill. The move saw many villagers abandoning their pet cats on the island, which prompted the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to step in and round up the animals. Through land reclamation works, the island eventually became part of the larger Pulau Semakau landfill, which began operations in 1999.",Object size: 10.5 x 14.9 cm,,National Museum of Singapore,1184552,https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1184552

The artist has taken some liberty in depicting the size of the pirate boats, perhaps in an effort to paint the British anti-piracy campaign in a heroic light by having a small gunboat engaging larger pirate vessels. Numerous anti-piracy expeditions were carried out by the British and the Dutch throughout the 19th century in an effort to stamp out raids on merchant vessels carried out by tribes of sea nomads known as Orang Laut. These raids, which were deemed legitimate acts under Malay customary law when carried out on behalf of local rulers, were considered illegal by the Europeans and dismissed as mere barbarous acts of piracy. Such ‘pirate’ activities surged in the mid 19th century and spanned the Straits of Malacca in the west to the Moluccas in the east. Besides the Orang Laut, the Iranun from the Sulu Archipelago were another prominent tribe that engaged in sea raids, often setting out in large fleets around May each year with the southwest monsoon and reaching the Malay Peninsula in August, which marked the start of the three-month long ‘pirate season’. Besides employing military force to curb raiding activities, the British and Dutch also relied on a system of alliances with Malay rulers as well as treaties that delineated maritime boundaries.
